# **Exploratory Data Analysis of Data Science Salaries**
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of data science salaries in the United States. The project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to the variation in salaries among data science professionals and to provide insights into the current trends and patterns in the industry.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is a public dataset compiled from various sources, including job postings, salary surveys, and other public data. The dataset contains information on the salaries of data science professionals, as well as their job titles, company size, location, work year, and experience.

## **Methods**
The EDA was conducted using the Python programming language and various data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Descriptive statistics and visualizations were generated to explore the relationships between the variables and the distribution of the data.

## **Results**
The EDA revealed several interesting insights into the data science salary landscape. Some of the key findings include:

The average salary for a data scientist is around $137570 per year, but this varies significantly depending on factors such as company size, location, work year, and experience.
Data scientists with specialized skills such as machine learning and big data tend to earn higher salaries than those without these skills.
In both large and small companies, as well as medium-sized ones, full-time employees receive the highest pay, whereas part-time employees and freelancers are compensated at a lower rate compared to full-time employees and contractors.
Employees who work remotely 50% of the time receive the lowest pay compared to those who work remotely 100% of the time, and this is consistent across all companies. The latter group of employees receive higher compensation than the former.

## **Conclusion**
Overall, the EDA provides valuable insights into the data science salary landscape and highlights the importance of factors such as work year, experience level, employment type, remote_ratio, company_location, company_size. in determining salaries. The project demonstrates the use of EDA techniques to explore and analyze complex datasets and can serve as a starting point for further research and analysis in this field.
